This is a small software to couple OpenVSP and Calculix. With the help of the software, an aeroelastic analysis can be made. The result is a deformed wing geometry in OpenVSP.
Due to a meshing error ing the OpenVSP API, the strucutral geometry has to be created beforehand, so some features are not working (eg.: iterative method, geometry modifications).
